LESSONS LEARNED FROM NODE.JS STUFF SO FAR
-----------------------------------------

- npm is awesome
- Windows support is horrible

BEGINNING NODE.JS
-----------------

Beginner's guide:

Getting started with Node.js, npm, Coffeescript, Express, Jade and Redis

NPM
---

NPM = Package manager for Node

General stuff about packages

- Global module location (under ~)
- Local modules under project (node_modules/)

Install new package:

	npm install [packagename]

List modules under current project:

	npm list

BEGINNING EXPRESS.JS (AND MONGODB)
----------------------------------

http://howtonode.org/express-mongodb

Omg:

	mkdir [project]
	cd project
	express -c stylus
	npm install -d

DEPLOYING NODE

NODE.JS ON WINDOWS
------------------

In Windows 7 global modules are at:
	~/AppData/Roaming/npm/node_modules

Installing Contextify on Windows from git
-----------------------------------------

Open console and run (https://github.com/brianmcd/contextify/pull/17):

	npm install -g node-gyp
	git clone https://github.com/brianmcd/contextify.git
	cd contextify
	node-gyp clean
	node-gyp configure
	node-gyp build

-> FAILS (msbuild.exe)
	-> Added "C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v2.0.50727" to path

-> FAILS (VCBuild.exe)
	-> VC++ compiler is needed, which I don't have
	- First thought: "F*** this, I'm gonna switch to Linux"
	-> Second thought: maybe somebody has already made pre-built binaries?
		- https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/360
		- https://github.com/Benvie/contextify/blob/master/build/Release/contextify.node

- Copied contextify.node (see above) under node_modules

Tried out if it works:

	node
	> require('contextify')
	{ wrap: [Function] }
	-> contextify loads OK

Problem: npm still struggles with installing modules that depend on contextify:

	npm install jsdom

	"Failed at the contextify@0.1.1 preinstall script.""

Back to drawing board.

Contextify "fork for Windows":

	- Installed Visual Studio (sigh)
	git clone https://github.com/Benvie/contextify.git
	Opened the VC project in Visual Studio
	- Build:	
	-> "Error	1	error D8016: '/ZI' and '/Ox' command-line options are incompatible"

Retrying via gyp (now Visual Studio is installed):

	git clone https://github.com/brianmcd/contextify.git
	cd contextify
	node-gyp clean
	node-gyp configure
	node-gyp build 

=> HELL YEAH!!!!!! (use `node-gyp build -v` for more verbose output)

Copied generated `Release/contextify.node` to `node_modules/contextify.node`

Tried out if it works in:

	node
	> require('contextify')
	{ ContextifyContext: [Function: ContextifyContext] }

Ok let's see what happens when we try to install some dependent libraries locally (like jsdom):

	npm install jsdom
	-> OK!
	- install -g fails
	-> Seems like its a good idea to plant this custom built module per project

Seems like I finally got it working with jsom by doing it this way:

	- Clean local node_modules folder
	- Copy freshly built contextify.node  under node_modules
	- Install jsdom with npm install jsdom
	- Make sure you don't spoil this build by letting npm f*** up contextify by auto-building it

What we actually needed:
	- node-gyp
	- MS Visual Studio
	- A LOT OF PATIENCE and keeping fingers crossed
	- This stuff seriously sucked
