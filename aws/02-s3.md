# AWS S3

S3 = Simple Storage Service. Secure, durable, highly scalable object storage

Key terms:

- **Bucket** - globally unique object container within S3
- **Object** - object stored within a bucket. Contains:
  - **Key** - name of the object
  - **Value** - contained data
  - **Version ID** - identifier for this specific version of object data
  - **Metadata**
  - **Subresources (Access Control Lists, Torrent)**
  
S3 has universal namespace. Bucket URL:

    https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/myaccount
    
S3 data consistency:

- read-after-write for PUTS of new objects
- eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETEs

S3 objects can be secured with enforced MFA on delete.

## Storage Tiers

- S3 standard - General purpose (11 x 9 durability, 4 x 9 availability)
- S3 Infrequent-Access - Infrequent access
- S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access - Infrequent access, data loss is tolerated
- S3 Intelligent-Tiering - Unknown or changing access, optimizes cost by moving data to most cost-effiecient tiering
- S3 Glacier - Archival, low cost, retrieval time in minutes
- S3 Glacier Deep Archive - Archival, very low cost, retrieval time in hours

## Access control

- **Bucket policy**. Bucket-level access control
- **Access Control Lists (ACL)**. object-level access control

## Versioning

- Enabled on bucket-level - can only be suspended once enabled, disabling requires deleting and re-creating bucket
- Creates new version on every update
- Accumulates size on every new version 
- Delete is handled by creating delete marker

Use lifecycle management to automate version handling

## Lifecycle management

- Per bucket lifecycle rules
  - Transitions: transition objects between storage tiers
  - Expirations: expire objects based on rules

## Encryption

- Encryption in Transit - with SSL/TLS using HTTPS
- Encryption at Rest (in server-side)
  - S3 Managed Keys (SSE-S3)
  - AWS KMS (SSE-KMS)
  - With customer-provided keys (SSE-C)

## Other S3 Features

- **Cross-Region Replication:** Replicate buckets between regions
- **S3 Transfer Acceleration:** Utilize CloudFront Edge network to accelerate S3 uploads
- **AWS Snowball:** Physical device for migrating large amounts (petabytes) of data to or from AWS S3
- **Storage Gateway:** Service that connects on-premises device with cloud storage (store data to AWS within on-premise IT)
  - Three types: file gateway (NFS & SMB), volume gateway (stored volumes, cached volumes), tape gateway (VTL)
    - Stored volumes: full volumes are stored on-premises
    - Cached volumes: only most frequently used parts of volumes are stored on-premises
