# A Tiny Windows PowerShell Guide for Linux Natives

<div>

</div>

The intend of this guide is to provide a quick and painless introduction of Windows PowerShell and its tools to users familiar with Unix and Linux shell tools.

## Motivation

**If you need shell tools for Windows, stop crippling yourself with old and unsuitable tools like Windows Command Prompt and Linux shell emulators. Seriously.**

For power users, command prompt is simply not good enough. Yes, you can use Unix-style shell emulators as well, but
they are hacky at the best. Granted that both the prompt and shell emulators can be used to do many of the
everyday tasks, but the more complex your tasks get, the less these tools provide you with good facilities.

Windows is not Unix. Factually, these two are completely different ecosystems. Many of
the design principles are shared, but the community and the tools are fundamentally different.
Unix tools are made from the premises of the Unix world; applicability to Windows is only a
potential afterthought. Similarly, it is a bad idea to assume Windows tools work smoothly in Linux.

If you want to work in Windows, I really encourage you to familiarize yourself with PowerShell. Yes,
it requires an initial investment of time and effort. Risk it and you may find yourself becoming very
comfortable and even more productive.

    <tr>
      <td><code>ps -aux | grep yourprocess</code><br>&nbsp;</td>
      <td><code>ps yourprocess*</code><br><code>get-process yourprocess*</code></td>
      <td>`ps` is an alias of `get-process`. `grep` works in PowerShell too, but unlike `get-process` it hides the table header.</td>

      <td><code>kill 1234</code><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</td>
      <td><code>kill 1234</code><br><code>spps 1234</code><br><code>stop-process 1234</code></td>

## Recipes

### Show Processes Consuming the Most CPU (`top`)

    while (1) { ps | sort -desc cpu | select -first 25; sleep 1}

### List USB Devices (`lsusb`)

    gwmi Win32_USBControllerDevice

### Download a File (`wget` or `curl`)

    (new-object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://example.com', 'output.html')

Or just get `curl` for Windows and run:

    curl http://example.com > output.html

### Rip CD/DVD (@TBD@)

Bash:

    cat /dev/sdb > file.iso    
    or
    dd if=/dev/sdb of=file.iso

### Manage Swap (@TBD@)

Bash:

    swapoff
    swapon [file]
