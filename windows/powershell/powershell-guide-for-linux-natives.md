</div>

The intend of this guide is to provide a quick and painless introduction of Windows PowerShell and its tools to users familiar with Unix and Linux shell tools.

## Motivation

**If you need shell tools for Windows, stop crippling yourself with old and unsuitable tools like Windows Command Prompt and Linux shell emulators. Seriously.**

For power users, command prompt is simply not good enough. Yes, you can use Unix-style shell emulators as well, but
they are hacky at the best. Granted that both the prompt and shell emulators can be used to do many of the
everyday tasks, but the more complex your tasks get, the less these tools provide you with good facilities.

Windows is not Unix. Factually, these two are completely different ecosystems. Many of
the design principles are shared, but the community and the tools are fundamentally different.
Unix tools are made from the premises of the Unix world; applicability to Windows is only a
potential afterthought. Similarly, it is a bad idea to assume Windows tools work smoothly in Linux.

If you want to work in Windows, I really encourage you to familiarize yourself with PowerShell. Yes,
it requires an initial investment of time and effort. Risk it and you may find yourself becoming very
comfortable and even more productive.

## Quick Start

### Open and Configure PowerShell

Find *Windows PowerShell* from the menu. Run it. If you are in Windows 7 or later,
I strongly suggest pin it to your taskbar (Right click -> *Pin to taskbar*). 

Personally I hate the default configuration. The bluish background makes
my eyes bleed. The standard window size is too small. Especially as paths
in Windows are typically very long, width of 80 is insufficient. Also
QuickEdit should be on by default, but sadly, it isn't. 

My preferred settings:

- **Settings**: check on *QuickEdit*
- **Font**: set type to `Consolas` and size to `14`
- **Window**: set buffer and window width `120` and window height to `40`
- **Colors**: set background to black (or whatever you prefer)

Restart and type `$Host.Version` to check which version of PowerShell you are running.
You should end up seeing something like:

**We are set to go!**

### Recipes

#### Show Processes Consuming the Most CPU (`top`)

    while (1) { ps | sort -desc cpu | select -first 25; sleep 1}

#### List USB Devices (`lsusb`)

    gwmi Win32_USBControllerDevice

#### Download a File (`wget` or `curl`)

    (new-object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://example.com', 'output.html')

Or just get `curl` for Windows and run:

    curl http://example.com > output.html

#### Run process with elevated access (`sudo`)

@TBD@

#### Change File Permissions (`chmod`)

@TBD@

#### Change File Ownership (`chown`)

@TBD@

#### Rip CD/DVD (@TBD@)

Bash:

    cat /dev/sdb > file.iso    
    or
    dd if=/dev/sdb of=file.iso
